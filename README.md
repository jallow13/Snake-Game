# Snake Game üêç

This is a simple **Snake Game** built using **Python's Turtle Graphics**. The objective of the game is to control the snake to eat the food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls or itself.

## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys to control the snake:
  - **Up Arrow**: Move Up
  - **Down Arrow**: Move Down
  - **Left Arrow**: Move Left
  - **Right Arrow**: Move Right
- The snake will grow longer each time it eats food.
- The game ends if the snake hits the wall or collides with its own body.

## Features
- **Randomized Food Location**: The food appears at random locations on the screen.
- **Colorful Snake**: The snake is multi-colored, with each segment having a random color.
- **Score Tracking**: The player's score increases each time the snake eats food. A "Game Over" message appears when the game ends.
